Creating a bare metal STM32 project without HAL or CubeMX project folder structure
==================================================================================

Just 'git clone' the appropriate CubeMX firmware package into the subdirectory "cube". 
You need the most up-to-date files from one of these.
CubeMX will download these automatically if you use it to create a project.

Copy the startup_xxx.s and system_yyy.s files into the source directory (here the root).

You'll have to make a dummy CubeMX project and copy the linker script STM32F3xyzbbc_FLASH.ld file into your project. This is the lamest step. Make sure that you tell CubeMX to create a "Makefile" type of project.
You can also copy one out of one of the project examples in the cube folder.

Now just create a Makefile by copying and tailoring the one from the CubeMX dummy project or the one given in this project's root.
